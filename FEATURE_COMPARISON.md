## II. Lesson Generation

### Before (Old System)

```
Chapter Content:

Chapter 1

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy
into chemical energy. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant
cells, where chlorophyll absorbs light energy...

[Plain text regurgitation - no teaching]
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Just regurgitates original PDF text
- ❌ No pedagogical structure
- ❌ No learning objectives
- ❌ No vocabulary definitions
- ❌ No teaching methodology
- ❌ Boring and hard to understand
- ❌ Passive reading experience

### After (AI-Enhanced System)

```
Chapter Content:

✨ AI-Enhanced
Teaching Style: Direct Instruction

═══════════════════════════════════════
📌 Learning Objectives
═══════════════════════════════════════
✓ Understand the process of photosynthesis
✓ Identify key components (chlorophyll, chloroplasts)
✓ Explain light energy conversion
✓ Compare photosynthesis and cellular respiration

═══════════════════════════════════════
📚 Key Vocabulary
═══════════════════════════════════════
• Chlorophyll
  Green pigment in plants that absorbs light energy

• Chloroplasts
  Organelles where photosynthesis occurs in plant cells

• Thylakoids
  Membrane structures stacked in grana

• Glucose (C6H12O6)

═══════════════════════════════════════
📊 AI Summary
═══════════════════════════════════════
This chapter explores how plants convert light energy into
chemical energy through photosynthesis. This fundamental
process produces glucose for energy and releases oxygen as
a byproduct, making it essential for life on Earth.

[Then enhanced content with teaching style...]

Direct Instruction Style:
"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light
energy into chemical energy. Let me break this down step by step..."

Socratic Style:
"What do you think would happen if plants couldn't make their
own food? Let's explore how plants capture light energy..."

Constructivist Style:
"You learned that energy can't be created or destroyed. Now
let's see how plants capture and transform energy..."

Encouraging Style:
"Great question! Let's explore photosynthesis together. This
amazing process shows how life on Earth thrives..."
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ AI enhances content with pedagogy
