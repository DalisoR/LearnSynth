## Tips for Best Results

### 📝 Document Preparation
1. **Use clear filenames** - e.g., "Biology_Chapter_5_Photosynthesis.pdf"
2. **Well-structured content** - Documents with headings and chapters extract better
3. **Readable text** - Scanned PDFs with OCR work, but text-based PDFs work best
4. **Reasonable size** - Large documents (>50MB) should be split if possible

### 🔍 For Better Search
1. Ensure documents have good text structure
2. Use documents with clear chapter divisions
3. Upload multiple related documents to the same KB
4. Check embedding coverage in Analytics

### 🎓 For Lesson Generation
1. Choose teaching style that matches your learning preference
2. Select relevant Knowledge Bases for context
3. Generate multiple lessons with different styles to compare
4. Review and edit generated content as needed

## Troubleshooting

### "Upload failed"
- **Check file size** - Must be under 50MB
- **Check file type** - Only PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT supported
- **Try again** - Temporary server issues can be resolved with retry
- **Check connection** - Ensure stable internet connection

### "No chapters extracted"
- **Text-based PDFs work best** - Scanned images may not extract well
- **Try DOCX format** - Sometimes extracts better than PDF
- **Add chapters manually** - You can generate lessons from the full document

### "Document not appearing"
- **Refresh the page** - Sometimes needs a refresh
- **Check KB selection** - Ensure you're looking in the right KB
- **Try adding manually** - Go to KB → "Add Document" to add it

### Slow upload
- **Large files take longer** - Be patient with 20+ MB files
- **Stable connection required** - Pause other downloads
- **Check server status** - Backend may be processing other uploads
